        "Purpose and Advantages of NumPy in Scientific Computing and Data Analysis:\n",
        "NumPy (short for Numerical Python) is a powerful library used for numerical computing and data analysis in Python. It provides efficient data structures, such as multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a vast collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. NumPy is widely used in scientific computing, machine learning, and data analysis due to its high performance and versatility.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Purposes of NumPy:\n",
        "Efficient Array Storage:\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy provides the ndarray object, a highly efficient n-dimensional array that can store homogeneous data types (i.e., all elements of an array are of the same type). This is much more efficient than Python's native list for handling large datasets.\n",
        "Mathematical and Logical Operations:\n",
        "\n",
        "It allows for efficient element-wise operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc., on arrays. NumPy also supports advanced mathematical functions like linear algebra operations, Fourier transforms, and statistical analysis.\n",
        "Support for Multi-Dimensional Arrays:\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy provides support for multi-dimensional arrays, which is essential for handling more complex data structures (such as images, scientific simulations, and time series data).\n",
        "Interoperability with Other Libraries:\n",
        "\n",
        "Many libraries in the Python ecosystem, such as Pandas, SciPy, and Matplotlib, are built on top of NumPy. This allows smooth integration of data structures and operations across different libraries.\n",
        "Advantages of NumPy:\n",
        "Performance:\n",
        "\n",
        "Vectorized Operations: NumPy performs element-wise operations on arrays in a vectorized manner, which is faster than using Python loops. The operations are implemented in C or Fortran, making them much more efficient.\n",
        "Memory Efficiency: NumPy arrays are stored in contiguous blocks of memory, which makes them much more memory efficient compared to Python lists.\n",
        "Ease of Use:\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy provides a clean, easy-to-use API for performing complex mathematical computations. You can apply high-level mathematical functions directly to arrays without needing to write explicit loops.\n",
        "Broadcasting:\n",
        "\n",
        "Broadcasting allows NumPy to perform operations on arrays of different shapes without explicitly resizing them. This leads to simpler and more intuitive code. For example, adding a scalar value to an array will automatically apply the operation to each element of the array.\n",
        "Large Array Handling:\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy handles large arrays efficiently in terms of both memory and computation, making it ideal for working with large datasets in fields like scientific computing, machine learning, and data analysis.\n",
        "Mathematical Functions and Tools:\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy includes a wide range of mathematical and statistical functions, such as matrix operations, linear algebra (e.g., dot, eig), Fourier transforms (fft), and random number generation.\n",
        "Integration with C/C++ and Fortran:\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy provides seamless integration with low-level languages like C, C++, and Fortran. This allows users to write performance-critical components in these languages and use them within Python.\n",
        "How NumPy Enhances Python's Capabilities for Numerical Operations:\n",
        "Efficient Data Structures:\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy introduces the ndarray, which is a grid of values, all of the same type, indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers. This data structure enables efficient storage and manipulation of numerical data.\n",
        "Element-wise Operations:\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy allows for element-wise operations (e.g., addition, multiplication) directly on arrays without the need for explicit loops. This leads to cleaner and more concise code that performs better than traditional Python lists.\n",

        "The array_split() method in NumPy is used to split an array into multiple sub-arrays. Unlike other splitting functions like split(), array_split() can handle uneven splits, meaning it can divide the array into a specified number of sub-arrays even if the array size is not perfectly divisible by the number of splits. This flexibility is especially useful when working with data of uneven sizes or when the exact number of elements per sub-array is not critical.\n",

        "Handling Uneven Splits:\n",
        "\n",
        "When the total number of elements in the array is not evenly divisible by the number of splits, array_split() ensures that the split is as even as possible. The method distributes the remainder (extra elements) among the sub-arrays, so that some sub-arrays might have one more element than others.\n",
        "This is in contrast to methods like split(), which require the array size to be perfectly divisible by the number of splits.\n",
        "Return Value:\n",
        "\n",
        "The function returns a list of sub-arrays, each of which is a view of the original array (i.e., it shares the same data buffer). The number of sub-arrays is determined by the number of splits specified.\n",
        "Axis Parameter:\n",
        "\n",
        "array_split() can operate along any specified axis of the array (default is axis 0). This allows splitting multi-dimensional arrays along any given dimension (rows, columns, etc.).\n",
        "Handling of Uneven Splits:\n",
        "When the number of elements in the array does not divide evenly into the number of sub-arrays requested, array_split() will allocate as many elements as possible to each sub-array, distributing the remainder across the first few sub-arrays. For example, if the array has 10 elements and is split into 3 sub-arrays, the first two sub-arrays will receive 4 elements, and the third will receive 2 elements.\n",
